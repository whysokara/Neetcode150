##### Types of Binary Trees
* Full binary tree
* Complete BT
* Perfect BT
* Balanced BT
* Degenerate Tree

1. Full Binary tree => 
* either has 0 or 2 children

2. Complete BT => 
* All levels are completely filled except the last one
* the last level has all nodes to left as possible

3. Perfect BT =>
* All leaf nodes are at same level

4. Balanced BT =>
* height of the tree at max log(n) n = nodes

5. Degenerated Tree =>
* skewed trees

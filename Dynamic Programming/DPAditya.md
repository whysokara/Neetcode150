### Identification
* Choice => Recursion
* Optimal => DP

> Recursion is parent of DP
### There are 2 ways to go about DP Problems once we have recursion solution
* memoization
* top-down

### DP Patterns (Parent Questions)
1. 0-1 knapsack
2. Unbunded knapsack
3. Fibonacci
4. LCS
5. LIS
6. Kadane's Algo
7. Matrix Chain Multiplication (**)
8. DP on Trees
9. DP on Grid
10. Few others

##### Types of knapsack
* Fractional
* 0/1
* Unbounded ~ Multiple occurances allowed

#### 0-1 knapsack problems
1. Subset Sum
2. Equal Sum
3. Count of subset sum
4. Minimum subset sum diff
5. Target sum
6. # of subset & given difference

### Identification
* Choice => Recursion
* Optimal => DP

*** Recursion is parent of DP ***
### There are 2 ways to go about DP Problems once we have recursion solution
* memoization
* top-down

1. 0-1 knapsack
2. Unbunded knapsack
3. Fibonacci
4. LCS
5. LIS
6. Kadane's Algo
7. Matrix Chain Multiplication (**)
8. DP on Trees
9. DP on Grid
